# Jump Point Search
This is an implementation of [Jump Point Search](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~dharabor/data/papers/harabor-grastien-aaai11.pdf), an algorithm by Daniel Harabor and Alban Grastien. It speeds up uniform-cost grid search by taking advantage of the symmetry in the problem. My implementation supports loading in images to be used as maps with the GridMap class. Just note that the X,Y coordinates are flipped because of my usage of numpy on the back-end.
